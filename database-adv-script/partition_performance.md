# Table Partitioning Performance Report

## Implementation Overview
- Partitioned the `bookings` table by `start_date` using range partitioning
- Created monthly partitions for current and previous year
- Added a default partition for future dates
- Migrated existing data to the partitioned table
- Created appropriate indexes on the partitioned table

## Performance Tests
Test was carried out with mock data from the code below:
```sql
-- Generate 1 million mock bookings
INSERT INTO bookings (user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date, status)
SELECT 
    (random() * 1000)::int + 1,
    (random() * 500)::int + 1,
    CURRENT_DATE - (random() * 365)::int,
    CURRENT_DATE - (random() * 365)::int + (random() * 7)::int + 1,
    CASE WHEN random() > 0.1 THEN 'confirmed' ELSE 'cancelled' END
FROM generate_series(1, 1000000); 
```

**Test Query Used:**
```sql
-- Date range query
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM bookings_partitioned WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31';

-- Complex join query
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT b.*, p.amount FROM bookings_partitioned b JOIN payments p ON b.booking_id = p.booking_id WHERE b.start_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-03-31';

-- Aggregation query
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM bookings_partitioned WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-03-31' GROUP BY status;
