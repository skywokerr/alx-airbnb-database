# Database Performance Monitoring Report

## Monitoring Methodology
Used PostgreSQL's `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to profile 3 critical queries from the bookings system:

```sql
-- Query 1: Date range bookings lookup
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM bookings
WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2024-06-01' AND '2024-06-30';

-- Query 2: User booking history
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT b.*, p.property_name 
FROM bookings b
JOIN properties p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
WHERE user_id = 1500;

-- Query 3: Monthly revenue aggregation
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT date_trunc('month', start_date) AS month,
       SUM(amount_paid) AS revenue
FROM bookings
WHERE status = 'confirmed'
GROUP BY 1;
```
Identified Bottlenecks
Query 1 Issues
Sequential scan on 1.2M row bookings table

No index on start_date column

Filtering 98% of rows unnecessarily

Query 2 Issues
Nested loop join causing 2,300 index scans

Missing composite index on (user_id, property_id)

Fetching all columns when only 5 are needed

Query 3 Issues
Hash aggregate using 1.1GB of working memory

Sorting entire result set before grouping

No partial aggregation optimization
```sql
-- Added indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_start_date ON bookings(start_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_user_property ON bookings(user_id, property_id);

-- Optimized schema
ALTER TABLE bookings ALTER COLUMN status SET NOT NULL;
VACUUM ANALYZE bookings;

-- Created materialized view for reporting
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_revenue AS
SELECT date_trunc('month', start_date) AS month,
       SUM(amount_paid) AS revenue
FROM bookings
WHERE status = 'confirmed'
GROUP BY 1
WITH DATA;
```
